Welcome to my README.md . o O (I told to introduce myself with this)

-> Hello, I am a newbie at coding and I have no idea what I'm doing
-> Currently learning C++
-> Surely, one day I will be decent enough
-> It would be cool to learn to code some simple games and build a bit of my portfolio

<-> I don't know what else to put so, have a good morning <->
